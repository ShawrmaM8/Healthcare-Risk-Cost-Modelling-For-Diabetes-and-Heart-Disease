# Healthcare-Risk-Cost-Modeling-For-Diabetes-and-Heart-Disease
A machine learning project that predicts diabetes and heart disease risk using real datasets, optimized with simple economic cost modeling for smarter healthcare decisions.

# 🏥 Healthcare Risk Modeling with Economic Impact  
### A Case Study on Diabetes and Heart Disease Prediction

---

## 📌 Overview

This project explores the intersection of **machine learning**, **healthcare**, and **economic cost modeling**. We use real-world datasets to build disease risk classifiers (for **diabetes** and **heart disease**) and go beyond accuracy, evaluation metrics to evaluate models based on **economic consequences** — including the real-world costs of misdiagnoses.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict patient risk of diabetes and heart disease using classical ML algorithms (e.g. RandomForestClassifier, XGBClassifier)
- Evaluate model performance using **standard metrics** (e.g., accuracy, AUC, precision)  
- Integrate a **cost-benefit analysis** that models:
  - Cost of false positives (unnecessary tests)
  - Cost of false negatives (missed treatment)
  - Savings from early diagnosis  
- Optimize decision thresholds based on **total expected economic cost**
