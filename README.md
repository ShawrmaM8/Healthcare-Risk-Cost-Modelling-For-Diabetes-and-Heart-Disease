# Healthcare-Risk-Modeling-with-Economic-Impact-A-Case-Study-on-Diabetes-and-Breast-Cancer
A machine learning project that predicts diabetes and breast cancer risk using real data, optimized with economic cost modeling for smarter healthcare decisions.

# 🏥 Healthcare Risk Modeling with Economic Impact  
### A Case Study on Diabetes and Breast Cancer Prediction

---

## 📌 Overview

This project explores the intersection of **machine learning**, **healthcare**, and **economic cost modeling**. We use real-world datasets to build disease risk classifiers (for **diabetes** and **breast cancer**) and go beyond accuracy metrics to evaluate models based on **economic consequences** — including the real-world costs of misdiagnoses.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict patient risk of diabetes and breast cancer using classical ML algorithms  
- Evaluate model performance using **standard metrics** (e.g., accuracy, AUC)  
- Integrate a **cost-benefit analysis** that models:
  - Cost of false positives (unnecessary tests)
  - Cost of false negatives (missed treatment)
  - Savings from early diagnosis  
- Optimize decision thresholds based on **total expected economic cost**
